 * Affinity represents a degree of attraction between the sample and a particular category.

 * PMML deals with two kinds of affinities:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Distance between two points in an n-dimensional feature space. Smaller distance values indicate more optimal fit.</li>
 *   <li>Similarity between two feature vectors. Greater similarity values indicate more optimal fit.</li>
